Just a log of my thoughts and approaches for the solutions!
- Day 1 - Day 4: I learned the importance of regex, and tried to use it in my solves. I also made stupid mistakes which led to long debug hours, after some days though my debug abilities have definitely improved!
- Day 4: I used recursion with memoization and probably overcomplicated it but I am super proud of that solution
- Day 5: Part a was relatively straight forward, part b was extremely difficult. I was able to figure out the logic about the ranges on my own which I'm really proud of, but I couldn't get the code to work, so I copied a redditer's code. Part b of day 5 is unsolved by me. 
- Day 6: Easy Math day :)
- Day 7: My favorite problem cuz its about card games which I really like
- Day 8 - 9: blur I can't remember, but the solutions seem interesting enough
- Day 10: Part b logic I couldn't figure out on my own. I learned about a new alg called for it, and i was able to figure out the code relatively easily after that
- Day 11: Nothing special
(FINALS HAVE STARTED AT THIS POINT SO SCHOOL IS A THING)
- Day 12: Recursion + some pruning, and then used functools.cache for memoization. (kind of lazy but couldn't figure out how to do it without)
- Day 13: Terrible code, cannot figure out a better solution, but it works
    - Reddit Tips after: should have counted differences instead and that would have made the conversion to part 2 extremely easy
- Day 14: 
- Day 15: Implemented Hashmaps using arrays and linked lists, even though that was not required, my best day in terms of placement
- Day 16:
